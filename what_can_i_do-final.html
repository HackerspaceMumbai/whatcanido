<h1>What Can I Do ?</h1>
<h4>Carbon footprint</h4>
<p>The carbon dioxide that is emitted as a result of all the things that each of us does and the energy we use is known as our carbon footprint and we all need to do what we can to make that footprint smaller. We still need energy to fuel our daily lives, and thankfully there is an alternative to using fossil fuels in the form of renewable energy.The carbon dioxide that is emitted as a result of all the things that each of us does and the energy we use is known as our carbon footprint and we all need to do what we can to make that footprint smaller. We still need energy to fuel our daily lives, and thankfully there is an alternative to using fossil fuels in the form of renewable energy.</p>
<h2>Control Measures:</h2>
<h3>&#49&#46 At Home</h3>
<h4>Reduce, reuse, recycle:</h4>

<p>Reducing, reusing, and recycling in your home helps conserve energy and reduces pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from resource extraction, manufacturing, and disposal. If there is a recycling program in your community, recycle your newspapers, beverage containers, paper, and other goods. Also, composting your food and yard waste reduces the amount of garbage that you send to landfills and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Visit EPA's Individual WAste Reduction Model (iWARM) to learn about the energy benefits of recycling, rather than landfilling, common waste products.</p> 
<br />
<br />
<h4>Use water efficiently:</h4>

<p>It takes lots of energy to pump, treat, and heat water, so saving water reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Saving water around the home is simple. Three percent of the nation's energy is used to pump and treat water so conserving water conserves energy that reduces greenhouse gas pollution. Reduce the amount of waste you generate and the water you consume whenever possible. Pursue simple water-saving actions such as not letting the water run while shaving or brushing teeth and save money while conserving water by using products with the WaterSense label. Did you know a leaky toilet can waste 200 gallons of water per day? Repair all toilet and faucet leaks right away. Running your dishwasher only with a full load can save 100 pounds of carbon dioxide and $40 per year. Be smart when irrigating your lawn or landscape. Only water when needed, and do it during the coolest part of the day; early morning is best. See EPA's WaterSense site for more water saving tips.</p>
<br />
<h3>&#50&#46 At Office</h3>
<h4>Manage your office equipment energy use better</h4>

<p>Did you know that the total electricity consumed by idle electronics equals the annual output of 12 power plants? Save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at work by setting your computer, monitor and other office equipment to power down when not in use. Activate the power management features on your computer and monitor, unplug laptop power cords when not in use and turn off equipment and lights at the end of the day. Plugging everything into a power strip makes it easy to shut everything down at one time.</p>
<br />
<h3>&#51&#46 On Road</h3>
<h4>Drive smart</h4>

<p>To improve your fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, go easy on the brakes and gas pedal, avoid hard accelerations, reduce your time spent idling (no more than 30 seconds), and unload unnecessary items in your trunk to reduce weight. If you have a removable roof rack and you are not using it, take it off to improve your fuel economy. Use cruise control if you have it, and for vehicles with selectable four-wheel drive, consider operating in two-wheel drive mode when road conditions make it safe to do so.</p>
<br />
<br />
<h4>Remember maintenance</h4>

<p>Get regular tune-ups, follow the manufacturer&#39s maintenance schedule (which can be found in your owner&#39s manual), and use the recommended grade of motor oil. A well&#45maintained car is more fuel&#45efficient, produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions, is more reliable, and is safer!</p>
<br />
<h3>&#52&#46 For Students</h3>
<p>Students can play an important role in reducing greenhouse emissions at their schools,colleges or universities by reducing their emissions from energy they use in dorm rooms. Students can also work with school administrators , increase energy efficiency on campus, and reduce their school's greenhouse gas emissions by using green power</p>

	If there were no greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the Earth would be a very cold place.

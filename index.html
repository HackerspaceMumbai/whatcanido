			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<br>
			<p>
				Our Earth is warming. Earth's average temperature has risen by 1.4&#176F over the past century, and is projected to rise another 2 to 11.5&#176F over the next hundred years. Small changes in the average temperature of the planet can translate to large and potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			The evidence is clear. Rising global temperatures have been accompanied by changes in weather and climate. Many places have seen changes in rainfall, resulting in more floods, droughts, or intense rain, as well as more frequent and severe heat waves. The planet's oceans and glaciers have also experienced some big changes - oceans are warming and becoming more acidic, ice caps are melting, and sea levels are rising. As these and other changes become more pronounced in the coming decades, they will likely present challenges to our society and our environment.

            <p>The GIF below is a consolidated version of NASA&#39s full animation that helps illustrate just how drastic the change has been since 1950. Temperatures in some regions have swung by as much as 4 degrees Celsius in the past 60 years alone.</p>

    If the Earth keeps getting warmer, up to one fourth of all the world's plants and animals could become extinct within 100 years.

   A hybrid car can go up to twice as far on a gallon of gasoline as a typical gasoline powered car.
